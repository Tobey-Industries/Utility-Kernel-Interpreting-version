# Utility-Kernel-Interpreting-version
The base of Launch Anything. This version of the kernel isn't 'flat' (flat means it is integrated with the code), the version in Launch Anything isn't an interpreter (an interpreter gives a framework of the kernel language to the processor and the the processor will be given the code to understand and then execute the code).
There are several modes that can be changed by changing the mode variable:
gui: GUI mode **Default*
silent: Silent mode **Has to be changed by renaming the file to util.pyw*
tui: Terminal UI mode
