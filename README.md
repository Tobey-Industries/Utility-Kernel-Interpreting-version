# Utility-Kernel-Interpreting-version
The base of Launch Anything. This version of the kernel isn't 'flat' (flat means it is integrated with the code), the version in Launch Anything isn't an interpreter (an interpreter gives a framework of the kernel language to the processor and the the processor will be given the code to understand and then execute the code).
